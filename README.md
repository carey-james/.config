### Oh My Zsh

[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master)

Oh My Zsh is used to customize the prompt in zsh in Terminal. 

A customm prompt is stored in `custom-zsh` and needs to be copied to the Oh My Zsh themes folder for it to function (as well as configured in `.zshrc`).

A custom color scheme is also used (not actually a part of Oh My Zsh but just a Terminal color scheme compatable with the custom theme). It is stored in `custom-zsh` as well.
